# Flatiron School Rapid EDAs
"Rapid" EDAs from my time at the Flatiron School
---
While I attended the Flatiron School Data Science program, I was tasked with performing exploratory data analyses within a short time frame. Depending on the scope of the dataset and task, we had 1-2 hours to gain as many insights as we could on a dataset using a Jupyter Notebook. There are three folders in this repository:

- `data`: The datasets that we worked with
- `EDAs`: The basic EDAs that took about 1-2 hours to complete
- `rapid_research_reports`: Folder containing one mini-project worked on over the course of ~12 hours, which includes a machine learning section

The environment I worked in used Python version 3.8.5.

Feel free to check these out!
